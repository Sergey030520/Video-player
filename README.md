# Video-player

The interface of a simple video player in the QML language has been created.

The main upper area of the interface is the player screen itself. The playback controls are located at the bottom, namely: the playback start button (Play), the playback pause button (Pause), the playback stop button (Stop), Rewind (Rewind), fast playback (Forward). Further behind them is the horizontal slider of the current playback location.
